UserData App

UserData App is a web-based application built using Java technologies that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations.
The project demonstrates how to connect a Java web application with a database using JDBC and Servlets.

Project Description

This application is designed to manage user information such as name, email, phone number, and address.
It provides a simple interface where users can add new records, view existing data, update details, and delete unwanted records.

The main purpose of this project is to understand how a Java web application works internally and how different technologies like Servlets, JDBC, 
and MySQL interact with each other.

Technologies Used

* Java Servlets – to handle server-side logic
* JDBC – to connect Java application with MySQL database
* MySQL – to store user data
* HTML & CSS – to create the user interface
* Apache Tomcat – to run the web application

How the Project Runs

1. The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat server.
2. When the user opens the application in a browser, the homepage is displayed.
3. User can choose to add, view, update, or delete records.
4. Each action sends a request from the browser to a Servlet.
5. The Servlet processes the request and interacts with the MySQL database using JDBC.
6. Data is stored, retrieved, updated, or deleted in the database.
7. The result is sent back to the user through web pages.

Simple Workflow

* User opens the application in browser
* User enters details in a form
* Form data is sent to a Servlet
* Servlet connects to database using JDBC
* Required operation (Insert/View/Update/Delete) is performed
* Updated result is shown back to the user

 Purpose of the Project

This project was created to learn and practice:

* Java web application development
* Working with Servlets
* Database connectivity using JDBC
* Performing CRUD operations
* Understanding client-server communication
